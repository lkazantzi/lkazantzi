My name is Lavrentios Kazantzidis and Î™ am a Theoretical Physicist with a PhD in Cosmology from the [Department of Physics](http://www.physics.uoi.gr/en) at the [University of Ioannina](https://www.uoi.gr/en/), under the supervision of Prof. [Leandros Perivolaropoulos](https://cosmology.physics.uoi.gr/lperivolaropoulos/). Currently working as a Junior Software Engineer at [Niki Ltd Digital Engineering](https://niki-mepe.gr/).

During my PhD studies I focused on the main (theoretical and observational) problems that plague &Lambda;CDM, the Standard Cosmological Model that describes our Universe extremely well. Analysing a variety of cosmological data, I studied a plethora of alternative models (modified theories of gravity) that may be supported by the data and identified their observational signatures based on the provided quality of fit. 


In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, watching movies, reading books and polishing my programming skills. On this website, you will find further information about my publication record, my detailed curriculum vitae as well as my portfolio. So start scrolling and have fun!
