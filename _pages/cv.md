* Junior Software Engineer, July 2023-Present
  - Niki Ltd Digital Engineering
  - Working in the automotive industry implementing the Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) method of testing, in collaboration with interdisciplinary teams. In the HiL method of testing authentic signals from a controller are linked to a simulated test system, creating the illusion that the controller is interacting with an actual assembled product, using computer simulation tools and technologies. As a result, a large number of potential scenarios can be efficiently explored to test the controller without the need for expensive and time-consuming physical tests.

**Title:** Dark Energy from Generalized Gravitational Theories with a Time-dependent Newton’s Constant (scalar tensor theories) <br>
**Abstract:** This work is focused on alternatives forms of Dark Energy. The challenges that &Lambda;CDM faces led to a variety of alternative models, such as extra dimensions, quintessence models, f(R) extended gravity theories, scalar tensor scalar tensor quintessence models etc. The main goal of my master thesis is to investigate the cosmological dynamics for general scalar tensor quintessence field models. Firstly, we introduce the reader to the mathematical formalism of  Standard Cosmology and then, we study alternative theories that can play the role of Dark Energy such as quintessence models based on linear-negative potentials of the form V(&phi;)=-s &sdot; &phi;. In the second part of this work we review the scalar tensor quintessence field models and their theoretical background. We investigate the equation of state parameter w(z) for these particular models and we use the Union2.1 dataset of 580 SnIa as a validity test and to explore the observational consistency of the theoretical model and its predictions for the fate of our Universe. Finally we study qualitatively different potentials of the form V=s &sdot;|&phi;|<sup>n</sup> and and use, once again the Union2.1 dataset as a consistency test of our model.<br>

**Title:** Cosmological Implications of Scalar Tensor Theories <br>
**Abstract:** In this PhD dissertation we study the cosmological consequences of modified theories of gravity. Motivated by the theoretical and observational challenges of the concordance model ΛCDM, we use up to date cosmological data from both geometric and dynamical probes to constrain modified gravity theories and extract the relevant best fit parameters. In particular, we first introduce the reader to the mathematical formalism of standard cosmology and then focusing on one of the two major tensions that ΛCDM faces, we introduce a purely phenomenological parametrization for the evolving Newton's constant and constructing an up to date compilation of growth data we extract its best fit parameters. Then, we study viable modified theories of gravities (such as f(R) and scalar tensor theories) in order to see if they have the potential to support the observed behavior the evolving Newton's constant. Moreover, we examine other cosmological data (such as the low l Cosmic Microwave Background data as well as the Pantheon compilation, i.e. the latest publicly available Type Ia Supenovae compilation that is publicly available) to impose strong constraints on the phenomenological parametrization for the evolving Newton's constant. Next, we study the constraining power (sensitivity) of a wide range of cosmological observables on cosmological parameters, showing that the sensitivity is actually a rapidly varying function of the redshift where the observable is measured and not a monotonically increasing function. In addition, we consider two late time gravitational transition dark energy models that have the ability to simultaneously tackle both the Hubble and growth problems and using the full Cosmic Microwave Background data as well as some other up to date cosmological data, we obtain their quality of fit and compare it with the quality of fit provided by other well studied dark energy models that have been proposed as possible solutions in the literature as well as with the concordance model of standard cosmology. Finally, we study the impact of various modified gravity models in the sub-mm scales using the data of the Washington experiment.
