In this project a dark energy model that has a rapid transition of the equation of state parameter accompanied by a similar transition on the absolute magnitude is
proposed as a possible solution to the Hubble tension. Using various cosmological data (such as Cosmic Microwave Background data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, Type Ia Supernovae data as well as Cosmic Chronometer data) we identify the best fit values of the parameters of this model and pinpoint the physical predictions of the dark energy model in question. For the constuction of the code Mathematica 12 was used.
