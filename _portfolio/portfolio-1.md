The goal of this project is to perform a data analysis of various cosmological models (such as the standard cosmological scenario and a modified gravity scenario with an evolving Newton's cosntant) using a compilation of 64 Redshift Space Distortion cosmological data. For the constuction of the code Mathematica 10 was used.
