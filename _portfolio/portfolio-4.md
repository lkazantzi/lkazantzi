The goal of this project is to perform a short statistical analysis based on the xgoals (xG) of three football clubs that compete in the Premier League (Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool) for the 21/22 season. In a nutshell, the xG correspond to the number of goals that can be expected to be scored based on where and how a shot was taken. Therefore, using this metric a qualitative understanding of each match is achieved and utilizing the data from each matchweek, the form of each team is derived.

The data for the three teams were obtained from [understat.com](https://understat.com/) and are analysed using Python, Excel as well as Mathematica.
