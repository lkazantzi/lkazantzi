This project is a follow up work in which we constrain the Late w-M Transition Dark Energy model modifying [MontePython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public), a program that performs MCMC calculations in order to calculate the best fit values of the parameters. For this purpose we substitute the default `background.c`, `input.c` and `background.h` files with the ones that are included in the github repository.
