Abstract
========
A rapid phantom transition of the dark energy equation of state parameter w at a transition redshift z<sub>t</sub><0.1 of the form w(z)=-1+&Delta;w&middot;&Theta;(z<sub>t</sub>-z) with &Delta;w<0 can lead to a higher value of the Hubble constant while closely mimicking a Planck18/&Lambda;CDM form of the comoving distance  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r(z)=\int_0^z\frac{dz'}{H(z')}"> for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z>z_t">. Such a transition however would imply a significantly lower value of the SnIa absolute magnitude M than the value M<sub>C</sub> imposed by local Cepheid calibrators at z<0.01. Thus, in order to resolve the H<sub>0</sub> tension it would need to be accompanied by a similar transition in the value of the SnIa absolute magnitude M as M(z)=M<sub>C</sub>+&Delta;M&middot;&Theta;(z-z<sub>t</sub>)  with &Delta;M<0. This is a Late w-M phantom transition (LwMPT). It may be achieved by a sudden reduction of the value of the normalized effective Newton constant &mu;=G<sub>eff</sub>/G<sub>N</sub> by about 6% assuming that the absolute luminosity of SnIa is proportional to the Chandrasekhar mass which varies as &mu;<sup>-3/2</sup>. We demonstrate that such an ultra low z abrupt feature of w-M provides a better fit to cosmological data compared to smooth late time deformations of H(z) that also address the Hubble tension. For z<sub>t</sub>=0.02 we find &Delta;w&#8771;-4, &Delta;M&#8771;-0.1. This model also addresses the growth tension due to the predicted lower value of &mu; at z>z<sub>t</sub>. A prior of &Delta;w=0 (no w transition) can still resolve the H<sub>0</sub> tension with a larger amplitude M transition with &Delta;M&#8771;-0.2 at z<sub>t</sub>&#8771;0.01. This implies a larger reduction of &mu; for z>0.01 (about 12%). The LwMPT can be generically induced by a scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity with no need of a screening mechanism since in this model &mu;=1 at z<0.01.
