Abstract
========
Late time gravitational transitions at low redshifts z<sub>t</sub><0.1 have been proposed recently for the solution of the Hubble and growth tensions. Such transitions would naturally lead to a transition of the intrinsic type Ia Supernovae (SnIa) luminosity and absolute magnitude M at z<sub>t</sub>. They could be accompanied by a transition in the dark energy equation of state parameter w (Late w-M Transitions - LwMT). Here we compare the quality of fit to cosmological data of this class of models with the corresponding quality of fit of &Lambda;CDM and some of the best smooth H(z) deformation models (wCDM, CPL, PEDE). We use the full Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy spectrum data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data, the Pantheon SnIa data, the SnIa absolute magnitude M as determined by Cepheid calibrators and the value of the Hubble constant H<sub>0</sub> as determined by local SnIa calibrated using Cepheids.  We find that smooth H(z) deformation models have problems which are not shared by transition models: 1) They have a worse fit to low z geometric probes (BAO and SnIa data). 2) They favor values of SnIa absolute magnitude M that are lower compared to the value M<sub>c</sub> obtained with local Cepheid calibrators at z<0.01. 3) It has been shown previously that smooth deformation models tend to worsen the growth Ω<sub>m,0</sub>-σ<sub>8,0</sub> tension. We also find that a w-M transition model (LwMT) does not provide a better quality of fit to cosmological data than a pure M-transition model (LMT) where w is fixed to the &Lambda;CDM value w=-1 at all redshifts. We conclude that the LMT models have significant advantages over smooth late time H(z) deformation models in addressing the Hubble problem.

Instruction - CLASS Implementation
========
You sent
* Install the [CLASS](https://github.com/brinckmann/class_public) and [MontePython programs](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public) as it is described in their official repositories.

* Substitute the appropriate files with the corresponding ones inside the folder CLASS Implementations and run the programs as usual. For a step-by-step guide of the modifications implemented in CLASS, [click here](https://cosmology.physics.uoi.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Class_Implementation-1.pdf).

* In our analysis we include a robust Redshift Space Distortion compilation presented [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10822.pdf). For the implementation of the likelihood follow the instructions of [this](https://github.com/snesseris/RSD-growth) github repository.
