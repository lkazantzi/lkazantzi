Abstract
========
Dark energy with equation of state parameter w<-1 can produce amplified cosmic acceleration at late times, thus increasing the value of H<sub>0</sub> favoured by CMB data and releasing the tension with local measurements of H<sub>0</sub>. In order to demonstrate this hypothesis, we show that the best fit value of H<sub>0</sub> in the context of the CMB power spectrum is degenerate with a constant equation of state parameter w,  in accordance with the approximate effective linear equation H<sub>0</sub>+30.93&middot;w-36.47=0 This equation is derived by assuming that both &Omega;<sub>0m</sub>&middot;h<sup>2</sup> and the co-moving angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface ![$d_A=\int_0^{z_{rec}}\frac{dz}{H(z)}$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24d_A%3D%5Cint_0%5E%7Bz_%7Brec%7D%7D%5Cfrac%7Bdz%7D%7BH(z)%7D%24) remain constant and equal to their best fit Planck/&Lambda;CDM values as H<sub>0</sub>, &Omega;<sub>0m</sub> and w vary.  This  secures that the predicted CMB spectrum remains practically unchanged and equal to its best fit &Lambda;CDM form.  For w=-1, this linear degeneracy equation leads to the best fit H<sub>0</sub>=67.4 km sec<sup>-1</sup> Mpc<sup>-1</sup> as expected. For w=-1.22 the corresponding predicted CMB best fit Hubble constant is H<sub>0</sub>=74 km sec<sup>-1</sup> Mpc<sup>-1</sup> which is identical with the value obtained  by local distance ladder measurements, therefore leading to an apparent resolution of the Hubble tension. We verify the above H<sub>0</sub> degeneracy equation by fitting a wCDM model with fixed values of w to the Planck data and show that the above linear degeneracy equation is accurate to within less than 0.63% in the range -1.5<w<1, while the quality of fit to the Planck data remains practically unchanged in the parameter region. Finally we show how these results can be extended in the case of an evolving equation of state parameter w(z) leading to degenerate regions in the parameter space of parameters appearing in the form of w(z) where the predicted CMB power spectrum remains practically invariant. We analyse in detail this degeneracy for the CPL parametrization and identify analytically  the full w<sub>0</sub>-w<sub>1</sub> parameter region that leads to a best fit H<sub>0</sub>=74 km sec<sup>-1</sup> Mpc<sup>-1</sup> in the context of the Planck CMB spectrum.
