Abstract
========
In this paper, we investigate the consistency of a decreasing G<sub>eff</sub>(z) with some viable scalar-tensor and f(R) theories. We stress that f(R) theories generically can not lead to a decreasing G<sub>eff</sub>(z) for any cosmological background. For scalar-tensor models we deduce that in the context of a &Lambda;CDM background a decreasing G<sub>eff</sub>(z) is not consistent with a large Brans-Dicke parameter &omega;<sub>BD,0</sub> today. This inconsistency remains and amplifies in the presence of a phantom dark energy equation of state parameter. However, it can be avoided for w>-1. We also find that any modified gravity model with the required decreasing G<sub>eff</sub>(z) and G<sub>eff,0</sub>=G, would have a characteristic signature in its growth index &gamma;.
