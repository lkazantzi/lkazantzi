Abstract
========
In this paper, we construct an updated extended compilation of  distinct (but possibly correlated) f&sigma;<sub>8</sub>(z) redshift space distortion (RSD) data published between 2006 and 2018. It consists of 63 data points and is significantly larger than previously used similar data sets. After fiducial model correction we obtain the best fit &Omega;<sub>0m</sub>-&sigma;<sub>8</sub> &Lambda;CDM parameters and show that they are at a 5&sigma; tension with the corresponding Planck15/&Lambda;CDM values. Introducing a nontrivial covariance matrix correlating randomly 20% of the RSD data points has no significant effect on the above tension level. We show that the tension disappears  (becomes less than 1&sigma;) when a subsample of the 20 most recently published data is used. A partial cause for this reduced tension is the fact that more recent data tend to probe higher redshifts (with higher errorbars) where there is degeneracy among different models due to matter domination. Allowing for a nontrivial evolution of the effective Newton's constant that depends on a purely phenomenological parameter g<sub>&alpha;</sub> and fixing a Planck15/&Lambda;CDM background we find g<sub>&alpha;</sub>=-0.91&plusmn; 0.17 from the full f&sigma;<sub>8</sub> data set while the 20 earliest and 20 latest data points imply <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=g_a=-1.28^{&plus;0.28}_{-0.26}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?g_a=-1.28^{&plus;0.28}_{-0.26}" title="g_a=-1.28^{+0.28}_{-0.26}" /></a> and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=g_a=-0.43^{&plus;0.46}_{-0.41}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?g_a=-0.43^{&plus;0.46}_{-0.41}" title="g_a=-0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.41}" /></a> respectively. Thus, the more recent f&sigma;<sub>8</sub> data appear to favor general relativity in contrast to earlier data. Finally, we show that this particular parametrization provides an excellent fit to the solution of the growth equation for both general relativity (g<sub>&alpha;</sub>=0) and modified gravity (g<sub>&alpha;</sub>&ne;0).
