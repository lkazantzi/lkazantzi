Abstract
========
We use a particular machine learning approach, called the genetic algorithms (GAs), in order to place constraints on deviations from general relativity (GR) via a possible evolution of Newton’s constant &mu;=G<sub>eff</sub>/G<sub>N</sub> and of the dark energy anisotropic stress 
&eta;, both defined to be equal to one in GR. Specifically, we use a plethora of background and linear-order perturbations data, such as Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, redshift space distortions, and 
E<sub>g</sub> data. We find that although the GA is affected by the lower quality of the currently available data, especially from the E<sub>g</sub> data, the reconstruction of Newton’s constant is consistent with a constant value within the errors. On the other hand, the anisotropic stress deviates strongly from unity due to the sparsity and the systematics of the E<sub>g</sub> data. Finally, we also create synthetic data based on a next-generation survey and forecast the limits of any possible detection of deviations from GR. In particular, we use two fiducial models: one based on the cosmological constant &Lambda;CDM model and another on a model with an evolving Newton’s constant, dubbed &mu;CDM. We find that the GA reconstructions of &mu;(z) and &eta;(z) can be constrained to within a few percent of the fiducial models and in the case of the &mu;CDM mocks, they can also provide a strong detection of several &sigma;s, thus demonstrating the utility of the GA reconstruction approach.
